Quito, Ecuador's capital city, was my first 'real' stop on my South American journey. I arrived in Quito from Bogota on the 3rd of July 2023.

One of the first things I noticed about Quito was the altitude. Standing at an elevation of about 2,850 meters (9,350 ft), it's the second-highest official capital city in the world. The altitude was definitely something to get used to, and I even with my level of fitness and countless Altitude Classes @ AltiPeak on the long mile road, I still found myself a small bit short of breathe when walking up the steep hills. But within a day or so, my body started adjusting to the height.

I decided to take part in a local walking tour â€“ a decision I'll never regret. Not only did I get to see some of the city's most iconic sights, but I also got the chance to dive head-first into the local cuisine. From the vibrant markets selling every fruit you could imagine, to street vendors offering local delicacies, the food was a highlight of my visit.

There was a particular food market that caught my attention with its enticing aromas and kaleidoscope of colors. Here, I tried 'llapingachos', a traditional Ecuadorian dish made with stuffed potato cakes, cheese, and a side of cooked sausage and eggs. Delicious!

During my stay, I bunked at the Secret Garden Hostel, a vibrant backpackers' paradise with an unbeatable view of the city skyline. The atmosphere was friendly and welcoming, making it a fantastic place to meet fellow travelers.

Quito, with its rich history, thriving culture, and spectacular landscapes, was a fantastic starting point for my South American adventure.

Next stop was to catch a night bus to Cuyabeno which is at the foot of the Amazon Rainforest in Ecuador.
