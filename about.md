Hi, I'm Dylan Redmond.

I'm a `Senior Cloud Infrastructure Engineer` based in Dublin, Ireland. I recently started working at <a href="https://www.workhuman.com/" target="_blank">Workhuman</a>.

I studied Electronic and Computer Engineering at <a href="https://www.dcu.ie/" target="_blank">Dublin City University</a>.


Before Workhuman I worked at <a href="https://www.paddypowerbetfair.com" target="_blank">Paddy Power Betfair</a> & <a href="https://www.paddypowerbetfair.com" target="_blank">Paddy Power Betfair</a>.


I joined PPB in January 2017 as a Football Exchange Operator on a part-time basis.
In this role I was responsible for managing the in-play <a href="https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/football" target="_blank">Exchange</a> markets for the highest profile matches across world football.

In September 2018, I moved into Cloud Automation with PPB. Working in a team based across four locations; Dublin, Cluj, London and Porto.

We were responsible for provisioning all of our cloud infrastructure, developing our framework and making it easy for our developers to deploy to production through CI/CD processes. (Across multiple DC's on both Openstack and AWS)

In my spare time, you can find me Refereeing football in Dublin across the <a href="http://ndsl.ie/" target="_blank">NDSL</a> and <a href="https://www.sseairtricityleague.ie/" target="_blank">Airtricity Underage Leagues</a>.
