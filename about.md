Hi, I'm Dylan Redmond.

I'm a `Cloud Support Engineer` based in Dublin, Ireland. I recently started working with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com).

I studied Electronic and Computer Engineering at [Dublin City University](https://www.dcu.ie/).

Before AWS I worked with [Paddy Power Betfair](https://www.paddypowerbetfair.com/).

I joined PPB in January 2017 as a Football Exchange Operator on a part-time basis.
In this role I was responsible for managing the in-play [Exchange](https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/football) markets for the highest profile matches across World Football.

In September 2018, I moved into Cloud Automation with PPB. Working in a team based across four locations; Dublin, Cluj, London and Porto.
We were responsible for provisioning all of our cloud infrastructure, developing our framework and making it easy for our developers to deploy their applications through CI/CD processes. (Across multiple DC's on both Openstack and AWS)

In my spare time, you can find me Refereeing football in Dublin across the [NDSL](http://ndsl.ie/) and [Airtricity Underage Leagues](https://www.sseairtricityleague.ie/){:target="_blank"}.
